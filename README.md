Build A Burger is a React application that allows you to build and order a custom burger.

Components are responsive and styled with CSS Modules and state management is handled with Redux leveraging a Firebase database.

User authentication persists using local storage and routes are protected by authentication.

Routes are designed with asynchronous "lazy loading" to speed up the application.

Testing handled with Jest and Enzyme.
